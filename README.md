# Sounds too good to be true, please tell me more
Ahh you got me. Paragraph above is the project's mission statement, and to be frank, it is not quite there yet.  
However, volunteers are always welcome to contribute. Please check out [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KKaCtaRZ/watexam) for current status of the project.


# Did you really need to make an app for this?
Of course not. This is an absolute overkill for such a simple task. However it is an excellent learning project for Android beginners. This particular project was perfect for practising API calls, handling JSON data and implementing a simple SQLite database.


That is all folks! Happy learning.  
Leo
